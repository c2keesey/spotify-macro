"""
Centralized flow character extraction utilities.

Handles playlist name parsing for flow relationships in the bidirectional flow system:
- Parent playlists: Special characters at the beginning (e.g., "ðŸŽµ Collection")  
- Child playlists: Special characters at the end (e.g., "Daily Mix ðŸŽµ")
- Flow relationships: Characters indicate hierarchical organization

This module consolidates the flow character logic used across multiple files.
