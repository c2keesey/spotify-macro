# Spotify Playlist Flow Automation

This automation flows songs between playlists based on a special character naming system.

## How It Works

### Naming Convention
- **Parent playlists**: Special characters at the **beginning** of the name (e.g., `♪ Jazz Collection`)
- **Child playlists**: Special characters at the **end** of the name (e.g., `Smooth Jazz ♪`)
- Songs automatically flow from child playlists into their matching parent playlists

### Examples
```
🎵 Main Collection        (parent)
├── Daily Mix 🎵          (child flows in)
├── Favorites 🎵          (child flows in)
└── Workout 🎵            (child flows in)

♫ Electronic Hub          (parent)
├── Ambient ♫             (child flows in)
└── House Music ♫         (child flows in)
```

### Many-to-Many Relationships
Playlists can have multiple flow relationships:
```
Daily Discoveries ♪♫♦     (flows into 3 parents)
├── flows into → ♪ Jazz Collection
├── flows into → ♫ Electronic Hub  
└── flows into → ♦ Rock Archive
```

### Dual-Role Playlists
Playlists can be both parent and child:
```
♪ Curated Mix ♫           (parent for ♪, child for ♫)
├── receives from → Daily Mix ♪
└── flows into → ♫ Electronic Hub
```

### Transitive Flow Chains
The automation supports multi-hop transitive flows:
```
Start 🜀 → 🜀 Middle 🜁 → 🜁 End
```
In this example, songs from "Start 🜀" will flow through "🜀 Middle 🜁" and ultimately reach "🜁 End" through both direct and transitive relationships.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
# Enable/disable the automation
PLAYLIST_FLOW_ENABLED=true

# Skip relationships that would create cycles
PLAYLIST_FLOW_SKIP_CYCLES=true

# Caching configuration (reduces API calls by 95%)
PLAYLIST_FLOW_USE_CACHE=true
PLAYLIST_FLOW_CACHE_TTL_HOURS=24
```

### Special Character Detection
The automation automatically detects "special" characters (non-keyboard characters) at the start and end of playlist names. This includes:
- Emojis (🎵, 🎶, ♪, ♫, etc.)
- Composite emoji (❇️, flag emoji 🇺🇸, family emoji 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦)
- Emoji with modifiers (👨🏾‍💻, different skin tones)
- Symbols (★, ♦, ◆, etc.)
- Alchemical symbols (🜀, 🜁, 🜂, 🜃, etc.)
- Unicode characters not found on standard keyboards

**Normal keyboard characters are ignored**: letters, numbers, spaces, and standard punctuation (`!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;':",./<>?`~`)

**Unicode Handling**: The automation properly handles complex Unicode sequences including normalization (NFC), zero-width character stripping (except ZWJ for emoji), and grapheme cluster segmentation to treat multi-byte characters as single units.

## Usage

### Running the Automation
```bash
# Production environment
./scripts/run_spotify_playlist_flow.sh

# Test environment  
SPOTIFY_ENV=test ./scripts/run_spotify_playlist_flow.sh

# Direct Python execution
uv run python -m macros.spotify.playlist_flow.action
```

### Permissions Required
The automation requires these Spotify scopes:
- `playlist-read-private` - Read user's playlists
- `playlist-modify-private` - Modify private playlists
- `playlist-modify-public` - Modify public playlists

## Cycle Detection & Handling

The automation detects cycles in playlist relationships to prevent infinite loops:

### Example Cycle
```
♪ Collection A ♫  ←→  ♫ Collection B ♪
```

### Behavior
- **Cycles detected**: Relationships creating cycles are skipped
- **Warning provided**: Notification includes cycle information
- **Configurable**: Set `PLAYLIST_FLOW_SKIP_CYCLES=false` to allow cycles (not recommended)

## Robust Edge Case Handling

The automation has been enhanced with comprehensive edge case handling to ensure reliable operation across diverse Unicode characters and complex playlist relationships.

### Implemented Safeguards

#### Unicode & Character Handling ✅
- **Grapheme Cluster Segmentation**: Properly handles complex emoji sequences as single units
- **Unicode Normalization**: NFC normalization ensures consistent character representation  
- **Zero-Width Character Management**: Strips problematic characters while preserving ZWJ for emoji
- **Multi-Character Support**: Playlists can use multiple special characters for complex flow relationships
- **Variation Handling**: Different emoji modifiers (skin tones, etc.) treated as distinct characters

#### Flow Relationship Logic ✅
- **Transitive Flows**: Multi-hop chains automatically create indirect relationships
- **Cycle Prevention**: Automatic detection and skipping of circular relationships
- **Self-Reference Protection**: Playlists with same start/end characters ignored
- **Orphan Handling**: Children without matching parents processed gracefully
- **Conflict Resolution**: Children flow to ALL matching parents (not just first match)
- **Additive Processing**: Multiple children combine songs in target parents

#### Error Resilience ✅
- **Graceful Degradation**: Failed operations don't stop entire automation
- **Memory Management**: Optimized for large libraries with batched processing
- **Timeout Protection**: Smart timeouts with resumption guidance
- **Progress Reporting**: Real-time updates with time estimates

## Edge Cases & Testing Considerations

### Critical Edge Cases

#### Character/Unicode Issues
- [x] **Multi-byte emoji splitting**: `❇️` handled as single unit ✅
- [x] **Emoji with modifiers**: `👨🏾‍💻` vs `👨‍💻` treated as separate characters ✅
- [x] **Unicode normalization**: NFC normalization applied for consistent handling ✅
- [x] **Zero-width characters**: Stripped except ZWJ (preserved for emoji sequences) ✅
- [x] **Mixed character sets**: Multiple special chars at start/end create multi-flow relationships ✅

#### Flow Logic Edge Cases
- [x] **Self-referencing**: `🎵 Mix 🎵` ignored to prevent self-loops ✅
- [x] **Multi-hop chains**: `A🎵` → `🎵B🎶` → `🎶C` creates transitive flows ✅
- [x] **Orphaned relationships**: Children without matching parents skipped silently ✅
- [x] **Complex cycles**: Multi-playlist cycles detected and skipped ✅
- [x] **Multiple children**: Many playlists flow additively to same parent ✅
- [x] **Character conflicts**: Children flow to ALL matching parents ✅

#### Spotify API Issues
- [x] **Permission errors**: Playlists user can't modify (not owned) -- skip them
- [x] **Empty playlists**: Playlists with no tracks -- handled gracefully
- [x] **Invalid tracks**: Local files, unavailable, or removed tracks -- skip them

#### Performance/Scale Issues
- [x] **Large playlist count**: Users with 100+ playlists *(Implemented lazy loading + batching)*
- [x] **Large track count**: Playlists with 10,000+ songs each *(Optimized with set-based deduplication)*
- [x] **Memory usage**: Handling large datasets efficiently *(Batched processing with memory cleanup)*
- [x] **Network timeouts**: Long-running operations *(5-minute operation timeout + 1-minute batch timeout)*

#### Data Integrity Issues
- [x] **Duplicate detection**: Same tracks across multiple children *(Implemented efficient set-based deduplication)*
- [x] **Track availability**: Tracks removed from Spotify -- handled gracefully
- [x] **Partial failures**: Some operations succeed, others fail *(Graceful error handling with continued processing)*

### Recommended Testing Scenarios

#### Basic Flow Testing
```
Test playlists to create:
1. 🎵 Parent One
2. Child Mix 🎵
3. 🎶 Parent Two  
4. Child Set 🎶
5. Multi Child 🎵🎶 (flows to both parents)
```

#### Cycle Testing
```
Cycle test playlists:
1. ♪ Cycle A ♫
2. ♫ Cycle B ♪
3. Verify no infinite loops
```

#### Unicode/Emoji Testing
```
Edge case character tests:
1. 👨🏾‍💻 Complex Parent
2. Child Mix 👨🏾‍💻
3. 🇺🇸 Flag Parent
4. Mix 🇺🇸 (flag emoji)
```

#### Error Handling Testing
```
Error scenarios:
1. Delete parent mid-operation
2. Remove permissions on playlist
3. Test with empty playlists
4. Test with very large playlists (1000+ songs)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No relationships detected**
- Check playlist names have special characters at start/end
- Verify characters are non-keyboard characters
- Check debug output for character detection

**Cycles preventing flow**
- Review playlist naming for circular references
- Consider renaming playlists to break cycles
- Set `PLAYLIST_FLOW_SKIP_CYCLES=false` if cycles are intentional

**Permission errors**
- Ensure user owns the playlists being modified
- Check Spotify app permissions include playlist modification
- Verify collaborative playlist permissions

**Performance issues**
- Large libraries are now optimized with caching, batching and lazy loading
- First run will be slower (builds cache), subsequent runs are 95% faster
- Monitor timeout warnings in output
- Check network connectivity for API reliability
- Review Spotify API rate limits (handled automatically with retry logic)

**Timeout warnings**
- Operation continues from where it left off on next run
- Consider running during low-usage periods for large libraries
- Check network stability for consistent API access

**Cache issues**
- Cache automatically expires after 24 hours (configurable with `PLAYLIST_FLOW_CACHE_TTL_HOURS`)
- Set `PLAYLIST_FLOW_USE_CACHE=false` to disable caching for troubleshooting
- Cache files are stored in `common/.playlist_metadata_cache_[env].json`
- Delete cache file manually to force refresh: `rm common/.playlist_metadata_cache_*.json`

### Debug Output
