## Core Flow System

### ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Upward Flow: Playlist Flow Automation

Automatic hierarchical music promotion using special character naming conventions.

#### How It Works
- **Child playlists** (ending with special chars): `Daily Mix üéµ`, `Favorites üéµ`
- **Parent collections** (starting with special chars): `üéµ Main Collection`
- Songs automatically flow from children to their matching parents
- Supports complex many-to-many relationships and transitive flows

#### Features
- **Cycle Detection**: Prevents infinite loops in playlist relationships
- **Unicode Support**: Handles complex emoji and special characters
- **Performance Optimized**: 95% API call reduction through intelligent caching
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Robust edge case handling

### ‚¨áÔ∏è Downward Flow: Classification Automations

Intelligent distribution of new music from staging to appropriate target playlists.

#### Multi-Strategy Classification
1. **Artist Matching**: Single-playlist artist detection (‚úÖ Implemented)
2. **Genre Classification**: Hybrid AI system with 76% accuracy (‚úÖ Implemented)
3. **Audio Feature Analysis**: Electronic music specialist patterns (‚úÖ Implemented)
4. **Integration Layer**: Cohesive classification pipeline (üîß In Progress)

#### Process Flow
1. **Staging**: Liked songs collected in staging playlist (e.g., "new")
2. **Classification**: Multi-strategy analysis determines target playlists
3. **Distribution**: Songs placed in appropriate child playlists
4. **Promotion**: Upward flow automatically moves songs to parent collections

   ```

3. See `CLAUDE.md` for detailed playlist flow feature documentation

#### Artist Matching Automation (Classification Component)

Core component of the downward flow system that intelligently distributes songs based on single-playlist artist patterns.

##### Artist Detection Features

- **Single-Playlist Artist Detection**: Identifies artists that appear in only one playlist for targeted curation
- **Flow-Aware Analysis**: Excludes parent playlists from uniqueness checking since they receive songs automatically
- **Smart Targeting**: Adds songs to child playlists where artists are manually curated
- **Hierarchy Integration**: Works seamlessly with upward flow to organize music hierarchically
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Checks for existing tracks before adding
- **Robust Error Handling**: Gracefully handles permission errors and API failures

##### Classification Process

1. **Mapping Phase**: Analyzes all playlists to build artist-to-playlist relationships
2. **Filtering Phase**: Excludes parent playlists (e.g., `üéµ Collection`) from uniqueness analysis
3. **Detection Phase**: Identifies artists appearing in exactly one child playlist
4. **Distribution Phase**: For each song in staging playlist:
   - Checks if any artist is a single-playlist artist
   - Places song in the target child playlist where that artist is curated
   - Allows upward flow automation to handle promotion to parent collections

##### Performance Impact

- **+471 More Single-Playlist Artists**: 22% increase in potential matches through parent exclusion
- **Intelligent Curation**: Songs flow naturally from discovery ‚Üí specialization ‚Üí collections
- **Automated Organization**: Respects playlist hierarchy and flow relationships
- **Reduced Manual Work**: Eliminates need for manual organization between related playlists

#### Setup

1. Ensure you've created a Spotify App as described above.

2. Run the artist matching automation:

   ```
   ./scripts/run_spotify_artist_matching.sh
   ```

3. Or run directly with Python:

   ```
   uv run python -m automations.spotify.artist_matching.action
   ```

#### Configuration

The automation works with any playlist named "new" as the source by default. You can modify the source playlist name in the code if needed.

#### Artist Distribution Analysis

Analysis tool for understanding collection patterns and optimizing both flow directions.

##### Analysis Features
- **Single-Playlist Artist Discovery**: Identifies artists for targeted classification
- **Curation Pattern Analysis**: Understands how music is distributed across playlists
- **Flow Optimization Data**: Provides insights for improving both upward and downward flow
- **Collection Health Metrics**: Tracks organization effectiveness and automation performance

#### Setup

1. Ensure you have downloaded your playlist data:

   ```
   python -m data.processing.download_playlists
   ```

2. Run the artist distribution analysis:

   ```
   python -m analysis.playlist.analyze_single_playlist_artists
   ```

## Creating a New Automation

To create a new automation:

1. Copy the template directory structure:

   ```
   cp -r automations/template automations/your_new_automation
   ```
