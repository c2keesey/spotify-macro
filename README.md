## Core Flow System

### ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Upward Flow: Playlist Flow Automation

Automatic hierarchical music promotion using special character naming conventions.

#### How It Works
- **Child playlists** (ending with special chars): `Daily Mix üéµ`, `Favorites üéµ`
- **Parent collections** (starting with special chars): `üéµ Main Collection`
- Songs automatically flow from children to their matching parents
- Supports complex many-to-many relationships and transitive flows

#### Features
- **Cycle Detection**: Prevents infinite loops in playlist relationships
- **Unicode Support**: Handles complex emoji and special characters
- **Performance Optimized**: 95% API call reduction through intelligent caching
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Robust edge case handling

### ‚¨áÔ∏è Downward Flow: Classification Automations

Intelligent distribution of new music from staging to appropriate target playlists.

#### Multi-Strategy Classification
1. **Artist Matching**: Single-playlist artist detection (‚úÖ Implemented)
2. **Genre Classification**: Multi-class composite system with 66% F1 score (‚úÖ Implemented)
3. **Audio Feature Analysis**: Electronic music specialist patterns (‚úÖ Implemented)
4. **Integration Layer**: Cohesive classification pipeline (üîß In Progress)

#### Process Flow
1. **Staging**: Liked songs collected in staging playlist (e.g., "new")
2. **Classification**: Multi-strategy analysis determines target playlists
3. **Distribution**: Songs placed in appropriate child playlists
4. **Promotion**: Upward flow automatically moves songs to parent collections

## Individual Automations

#### Spotify Add to Library

Save the currently playing Spotify track to your library with a keyboard shortcut.

#### Setup

1. Create Spotify Apps for both test and production:

   - Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)
   - Create two apps: one for testing, one for production
   - Set Redirect URIs:
     - **Test environment**: `http://127.0.0.1:8889/callback`
     - **Production environment**: `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback`

2. Create environment-specific configuration files:

   **`.env.test`** (for testing):
   ```
   CLIENT_ID=your_test_client_id_here
   CLIENT_SECRET=your_test_client_secret_here
   VENV_PATH=/path/to/your/project/.venv
   ```

   **`.env.prod`** (for production):
   ```
   CLIENT_ID=your_prod_client_id_here
   CLIENT_SECRET=your_prod_client_secret_here
   VENV_PATH=/path/to/your/project/.venv
   ```

3. Authenticate (SSH-compatible process):

   ```bash
   # Test environment authentication
   SPOTIFY_ENV=test uv run python scripts/spotify_auth.py url
   # Open the URL in any browser, get the auth code from error page
   SPOTIFY_ENV=test uv run python scripts/spotify_auth.py auth --code '<auth_code>'
   
   # Production environment authentication
   SPOTIFY_ENV=prod uv run python scripts/spotify_auth.py url
   SPOTIFY_ENV=prod uv run python scripts/spotify_auth.py auth --code '<auth_code>'
   ```

4. Follow the instructions in `workflows/spotify_save_current.md` to set up the Automator workflow and keyboard shortcut

   ```

3. See `CLAUDE.md` for detailed playlist flow feature documentation

#### Artist Matching Automation (Classification Component)

Core component of the downward flow system that intelligently distributes songs based on single-playlist artist patterns.

##### Artist Detection Features

- **Single-Playlist Artist Detection**: Identifies artists that appear in only one playlist for targeted curation
- **Flow-Aware Analysis**: Excludes parent playlists from uniqueness checking since they receive songs automatically
- **Smart Targeting**: Adds songs to child playlists where artists are manually curated
- **Hierarchy Integration**: Works seamlessly with upward flow to organize music hierarchically
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Checks for existing tracks before adding
- **Robust Error Handling**: Gracefully handles permission errors and API failures

##### Classification Process

1. **Mapping Phase**: Analyzes all playlists to build artist-to-playlist relationships
2. **Filtering Phase**: Excludes parent playlists (e.g., `üéµ Collection`) from uniqueness analysis
3. **Detection Phase**: Identifies artists appearing in exactly one child playlist
4. **Distribution Phase**: For each song in staging playlist:
   - Checks if any artist is a single-playlist artist
   - Places song in the target child playlist where that artist is curated
   - Allows upward flow automation to handle promotion to parent collections

##### Performance Impact

- **+471 More Single-Playlist Artists**: 22% increase in potential matches through parent exclusion
- **Intelligent Curation**: Songs flow naturally from discovery ‚Üí specialization ‚Üí collections
- **Automated Organization**: Respects playlist hierarchy and flow relationships
- **Reduced Manual Work**: Eliminates need for manual organization between related playlists

#### Setup

1. Ensure you've created a Spotify App as described above.

2. Run the artist matching automation:

   ```
   ./scripts/run_spotify_artist_matching.sh
   ```

3. Or run directly with Python:

   ```
   uv run python -m automations.spotify.artist_matching.action
   ```

#### Configuration

The automation works with any playlist named "new" as the source by default. You can modify the source playlist name in the code if needed.

#### Artist Distribution Analysis

Analysis tool for understanding collection patterns and optimizing both flow directions.

##### Analysis Features
- **Single-Playlist Artist Discovery**: Identifies artists for targeted classification
- **Curation Pattern Analysis**: Understands how music is distributed across playlists
- **Flow Optimization Data**: Provides insights for improving both upward and downward flow
- **Collection Health Metrics**: Tracks organization effectiveness and automation performance

#### Setup

1. Ensure you have downloaded your playlist data:

   ```
   python -m data.processing.download_playlists
   ```

2. Run the artist distribution analysis:

   ```
   python -m analysis.playlist.analyze_single_playlist_artists
   ```

## Creating a New Automation
