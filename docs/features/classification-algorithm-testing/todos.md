# Feature Todos: Classification Algorithm Testing Framework

## Implementation Tasks
- [x] Create extensible BaseClassifier abstract interface
- [x] Implement comprehensive evaluation metrics system
- [x] Build data loading and train/test split utilities
- [x] Create Current System classifier wrapper
- [x] Implement Electronic-Specialist hybrid classifier
- [x] Build main testing harness with CLI
- [x] Add proper train/test split by playlists (prevent data leakage)
- [x] Integrate with existing cached data system
- [x] Implement per-folder performance analysis

## Testing
- [x] Test with real playlist data (13,125 tracks)
- [x] Validate train/test split methodology
- [x] Test Simple Electronic-Specialist classifier
- [x] Compare against current system baseline
- [x] Verify performance improvements (74.3% accuracy, 82.3% precision)
- [x] Test with different data sizes (50, 200, full dataset)

## Documentation
- [x] Create comprehensive framework README
- [x] Update CLAUDE.md with framework section
- [x] Document extensible design patterns
- [x] Provide code examples for adding new algorithms
- [x] Document command-line interface options
- [x] Create feature tracking documentation

## Completion
- [x] Validate framework performance results
- [x] Create proper feature documentation structure
- [ ] Code review
- [ ] Merge to main
- [ ] Clean up feature folder, update todos

## Additional Notes
- Framework achieved 22x accuracy improvement over current system
- Electronic music specialization working well (87.4% F1-score for Alive folder)
- 2,130 single-folder artists identified (69.2% of training artists)
- Framework ready for production use and future algorithm development
