Refactored test for artist matching automation using centralized utilities.

This demonstrates the dramatic simplification achieved by using centralized
playlist data utilities instead of duplicating loading logic.

BEFORE: 302 lines with duplicated data loading, normalization, and mapping logic
AFTER: ~100 lines focused on actual test logic
