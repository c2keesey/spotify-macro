"""
Unified staging playlist classification automation.

This automation processes songs from a staging playlist (default: "new") and distributes them
to appropriate target playlists using intelligent multi-strategy classification:

1. **Artist Matching (Priority 1)**: If the artist appears in only one playlist, add to that playlist
2. **Genre Classification (Priority 2)**: Use hybrid genre classification system as fallback
3. **Confidence Scoring**: Single playlist artist (100%) > Genre classification (76% accuracy)

INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING SYSTEMS:
- Shares cache with playlist flow automation for optimal performance
- Uses existing artist matching logic from artist_matching/action.py
- Leverages genre classification from save_current_with_genre.py
- Integrates with telegram notifications and error handling

BIDIRECTIONAL FLOW INTEGRATION:
- Excludes parent playlists from artist uniqueness (they receive songs via upward flow)
- Targets child playlists where artists are manually curated
- Automatic promotion to parent collections happens via playlist flow automation
